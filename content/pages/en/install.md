The current stable release is Sozi 17.11 (November 2017):

  * [Download the stable release](https://github.com/senshu/Sozi/releases/tag/17.11)
  * [Download a preview version of the next release](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByRUreHgekjMWG9teGM2dE8wck0) (for testers)

Sozi is distributed in the form of a [zip archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29).
Unzipping the archive will create a folder with the same name.
Linux and Windows users will run Sozi by launching the `Sozi` executable inside that folder.
OS X users will find a `Sozi.app` subfolder that they can drag into their `Applications` folder.

An install script for Linux is provided.
After installation, Sozi can be run either from your desktop applications menu, or from the command-line as `sozi` (in lower case):

```
tar xzf Sozi-{version}.tgz
sudo ./Sozi-{version}/install/install.sh
sozi
```

Archlinux users can install Sozi from the [Archlinux User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sozi).
