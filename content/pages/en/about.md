##Sozi in a nutshell

Sozi is a zooming presentation editor and player. Unlike in most presentation applications, a Sozi document is not organised as a slideshow,
but rather as a poster where the content of your presentation can be freely laid out.
Playing such a presentation consists in a series of translations, zooms and rotations
that allow to focus on the elements you want to show.

Below is an example of what can be done with Sozi. More examples are shown [here](https://senshu.github.io/Sozi-demos){:target="_blank"}.

##The Sozi way

Ever been irritated by having to fit your ideas in fixed-size A4 paper sheets? Hard to find the page you're looking 
for amongst the 70 pages of your presentation? What's the point of A4 pages anyway, as no one prints presentations any more?

With Sozi, draw anything that you want on an unlimited size page, the way you like, with the vector graphics editor of your choice. Sozi turns your drawing into an animation, enabling to browse from place to place and zoom in areas of interest.

Freed from the obsolete A4 paradigm, you can start being creative using truly professional graphics editors, playing with layers, transparency and more.

##Open standards

Sozi uses open standards from A to Z, which is the core of our philosophy. It takes a vector image in the form of an SVG file, 
and outputs a single html file. This file contains your presentation and can be shared with others, and played in any internet browser without the need to install additional software. 

Because html is a very solid standard, used by bilions of people around the world, it guarantees that your presentation will play smoothly anywhere, and will remain useable anytime in the future.

##Free licence

Sozi is distributed according to the terms of the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/), meaning you can use, inspect, modify, and share the code freely. 

No limited-time testing periods or funny hidden features, everything is open. Sozi is still in construction, meaning it improves every day, thanks to the suggestions and contributions of its users.
