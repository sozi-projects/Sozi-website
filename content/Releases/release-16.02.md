Summary:
    Sozi 16 is the first release of 2016.
    It fixes several issues and adds new translations.

The following improvements were added to the presentation editor in this release:

* Several new keyboard shortcuts are supported (moving in the timeline with arrow keys,
  toggling fullscreen mode with F11, reloading the document with F5, saving with Ctrl-S).
* Sozi remembers the window geometry of the previous execution.
* Changing frame order unlinks the appropriate frames.

Sozi 16.02 is also available in Chinese (Taiwan).

If you want to help translate Sozi to your language, you will find [instructions for translators](|filename|/pages/en/translate-editor.md) on this site.
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/senshu/Sozi/issues) if you want us to add a new
completed translation file or update an existing one.
