Summary:
    I'm writing a book about Sozi.

Since 2009, a lot of people have tried Sozi and found it useful.
Amazing creations have been made with it, and I have received incredible support from all over the world.

Sozi is still a personal project that I develop mostly alone in my spare time.
Over the years, while many users, including myself, were expecting new features and bug fixes,
writing code has often felt like a better use of my time than writing documentation.

Today, I realize that the documentation for Sozi needs to be updated and reorganized.
I usually feel that some questions on the users forum would be easier to answer
if there was a real Sozi user guide available.
For this reason, I have started a complete rewrite of the documentation in the form of an online book.
I have also reserved a specific domain name for this book: [http://sozi.guide](http://sozi.guide)

Like Sozi, the book will be published under a free license, with no ads and no paywall.
I hope you find it useful and entertaining.
